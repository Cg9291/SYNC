Depending on your IDE / OS / settings. Here are some of mine:

Bare essentials, anything to do with selecting, copying, replacing text (They seem obvious, but I'm always amazed with how many people don't know these)

ctrl left/right - Skip a word

shift left / right - select a letter

ctrl shift left/right - select a word

ctrl home / end - go to beginning / end of document (also try +shift)

ctrl f - find

ctrl h - replace

ctrl a - select all

ctrl backspace / delete - delete word in front of / behind cursor

Then my IDE shortcuts (Visual studio)

F -muthafuckin- 12 - Go to definition

CTRL K + D - Format code

ctrl shift b - build all

f5 - debug program

shift f5 - stop debugging

ctrl s - save

ctrl shift s - save all

These are the common ones I guess. Then there are the windows shortcuts:

winkey R - Run dialog

winkey E - explorer

winkey L - lock computer

ctrl shift esc - task manager

ctrl shift N - new folder

alt tab, ctrl tab, alt f4, ctrl c, ctrl v, ctrl x,

That's all I can think off from the top of my head. I'm sure there's more I use.
